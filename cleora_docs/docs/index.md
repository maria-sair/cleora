# Cleora — Simple, Strong, and Scalable Graph Embedding Scheme

*Cleora is a genus of moths in the family Geometridae. Their scientific name derives from the Ancient Greek geo γῆ or γαῖα "the earth", and metron μέτρον "measure" in reference to the way their larvae, or "inchworms", appear to "measure the earth" as they move along in a looping fashion.*

Cleora is a general-purpose model for efficient, scalable learning of stable and inductive entity embeddings for heterogeneous relational data.

# Cleora PRO 
For Cleora PRO version visit our [website](https://www.cleora.ai/).

Key improvements in Cleora PRO over the open source version:

- automatic scaling: no expensive hardware required
- ease of use: only 3 columns extracted from your DB are required. Graphs are detected automatically in the data.
- performance optimizations: 10x faster embedding times
- latest research: significantly improved embedding quality
- new feature: item attributes are supported
